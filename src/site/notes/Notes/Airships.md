Following a set of general agreements between nations and sky-going communities, large Air-vessels are required to have a radio (with a set aside emergency frequency) and signalling capabilities (flags and flares). Smaller vessels are only required to have signals. Personal sized vessels are exempt from these requirements, but most will carry emergency signals and standard flag.
