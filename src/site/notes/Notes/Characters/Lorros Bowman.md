## Motivations
Lorros wants to live freely. He has an ideal situation living on the farm at [[Notes/Locations/The Goat's Rest\|The Goat's Rest]]. He loves  taking care of the farm animals.
He distrusts the anything greater than local authority, who are people he knows and has the measure of. 
Having caught deer in the past, and the law being that deer belong to the [[Notes/Alban Royal Family\|Alban Royal Family]], and illegal to hunt, he is fearful that he will be unjustly arrested - believing it to be an unjust law. This does not stop him from occasionally hunting deer and providing them for the stew as "beef", especially for special harvest celebration stews.
