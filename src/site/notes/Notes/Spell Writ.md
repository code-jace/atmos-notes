**Access & Availability**
Low-level spell writs are mass produced and easily bought throughout most of the skies, although the availability will change based on supply.

**Complexity**
The complexity of Spell Writs lies in their design, as they are all based on forgotten spells. To design a Spell Writ, a [[Notes/Magewright\|Magewright]] or team of magewrights work to reverse engineer spells recovered from before the [[Notes/Arcana Intercludo\|Arcana Intercludo]], when magic and wizards were at large. These spells have to be altered and updated to channel the energy through the Writ, with the writ's design acting as a conduit matrix.

Once a Writ is designed, they can be mass-produced by Magewrights. The spells that are created as Writs are regulated.

An example of mass-produced Spell Writ is a pocketbook of 20 tear-out Light spells. Similar books can be bought for everyday use spells, aimed at the general consumer. The writ does the hard work, allowing anyone to cast mundane spells.

### Utility
Spell writs are used to channel the energy of the complex Magisphere to cast spells. As with any magic, there is probably unlimited misuses.

### Manufacturing
The manufacture of Spell Writs first requires the research of old magical texts and the development of prototype writ by Magewrights. Once the writ design is finalised, the design can be copied and produced.Â  This procedure utilities special printing technologies, with magical inks, infused papers, and enchanted printers.
