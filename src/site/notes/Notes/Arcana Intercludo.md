#event #magic 
Magic as it once was, the Arcane arts and it's schools of training are no more. In the [[Notes/Cataclysm\|Cataclysm]], the [[Notes/Magisphere\|Magisphere]] became so turbulent that the equations and techniques required to conjure and control magical spells became so complex and physically taxing that wizardry was made incredibly difficult. 

That is to say, magic has become a gift. It is more regularly seen as performed by sorcerers -  those possessing the "spark", the natural connection  to the [[Notes/Magisphere\|Magisphere]] and aptitude required to manipulate it.

Traditional wizardry does exist, although only rarely performed due to its complexity - it takes not only a brilliant mind constant study to decipher old magical texts and convert spells to the new constantly warping [[Notes/Magisphere\|Magisphere]], but rare and powerful magical focuses.

Wizard Colleges work to research from old spell books and tomes to recover and rework old arcane spells so that they will work with the current state of magic, uncovering lost spells, creating experiments and rituals. From this research, some useful spells are then made into [[Notes/Spell Writ\|Spell Writ]] versions of them, for ease of use by non-magical folk.

Magic is still quite present in the forms of rituals, scrolls, and magic items and devices - these use materials and designs that act as a matrix that that will conduct the [[Notes/Magisphere\|Magisphere]] to perform the casting.
