#profession #magic
A Magewright is a mage that specialises in researching old pre-[[Notes/Arcana Intercludo\|Arcana Intercludo]] spells and the creation of usable [[Notes/Spell Writ\|Spell Writ]]s from these transcribed spells. A lot of Magewrites would only be low-level spellcasters but possess a strong theoretical knowledge of magic and the ritual casting that is required to create spell writs.
There is a branch of Magewrites for the design and creation of low-level "mundane" magic items, that are close to Artificer (in fact, advanced magewrites may become artificers). In a sense, Magewrights are the engineers of channelling the [[Notes/Magisphere\|Magisphere]] through external means, without themselves channelling the Magisphere.
