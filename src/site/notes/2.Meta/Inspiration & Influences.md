#meta 
This is like some sort of mood board/collection of various things and genres that fuel this world. 
- Storm Hawks - I think it's safe to say that a) no-one has watched storm hawks, b) it is a huge influence on this setting. They have that sort of crystal thing going, and its all set in the sky. AFAIK the show never really explained why they all live on top of mountains and such. I don't remember. Anyway, I like the whole crystal thing and the flying machines, although the flying bikes etc might be a bit away yet (not ruled out) just a matter of figuring out how to do them. Also can we talk about how there was one character who has someone follow him around with a violin just to play his leitmotif whenever he is on screen - beautiful.

- Fullmetal Alchemist. *Fullmetal Alchemist* - Magic, technology, both of those things at the same time. Strong and developed characters. What it contributes here is probably the concrete nature of the magic system and how grounded everything - while still fantastical was. It also was sort of my first foray into a show that had meaningful politics and touched on international relations. Also how more or less every story thread was tied up in the end.
- Mortal Engines - the books for the world building and story. Deep and interesting characters that subvert the norm in a way that feels very real. The film for some beautiful visuals.
- Leviathan book series - I think this was my first dip into alternate history.  It has airships and some of them are living things. 
- Star Wars - goes without saying. The ultimate in peasant boy meets a wizard journeys. Also Empires and Rebels. 
- Dune - Intrigue. Plans within plans. Do I have many? I have a few maybe. 
- Battlestar Galactica - Space Opera with grit. Great characters and big questions. Very tense. I like the idea of huge spaceship and a crew. Likely translates to Airship or something in the setting.
- Space Battleship Yamato - a theme emerges... Space Opera with less grit but more wearing hearts on sleeves. Very dramatic, and with very cool technology and morals.
- Legend of the Galactic Heroes - The opposite extreme of Space Opera, in that its practically an opera in the original sense. So many developed characters. Almost too many. I hope to be as in depth.  Does a similar to Star Wars with an empire and the alliance, but its far more grey. Shows it from both sides which as a sandbox, I hope to be able to do.
- The Legend of Zelda
- Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind/ Laputa Castle in the Sky/ whatever studio Ghibli is doing with their worldbuilding and themes.
