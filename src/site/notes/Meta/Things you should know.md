# Playstyle
It should go without saying that the flavour of the game is decided per campaign by all the players. All campaigns will be fairly persistent and exist in the same universe, perhaps on different skylands or timespans or areas. 
A campaign can have a variable level of seriousness, which can (and should) change over the course of the campaign, but in a general sense all players should know what sort of thing that they want at the start of the campaign and then plan/play accordingly. *A more serious than wacky campaign should have characters that are more serious than wacky, a more wacky than serious campaign can have characters that are more wacky.* The writing of this is to provide the pointer that this dialling in of flavour is to be shared and discussed by players at the table, so that everyone is fairly on the same page regarding expectations.

Essentially: where do you fall on a scale of: 
- The Lord of the Rings
- A Knight's Tale 
- Holy Grail
