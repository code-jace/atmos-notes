Strata Impervia is a term used to refer to the incredibly resistant, and thus effectively impassable layer of rock that occurs in mountaintops that ascend through the [[1.Notes/Barrier Cloud\|Barrier Cloud]] from the surface below. 
If the Barrier Cloud is the liquid or gaseous barrier to the surface, then the Strata Impervia is the hard, solid barrier. The Strata Impervia occurs in line with the Barrier Cloud. 

It prevents attempts to mine down through mountains to create a means of reaching the surface below via mine shaft. 

Outcrops of [[1.Notes/Energy Crystal\|Energy Crystal]]s are common at mining depths close to the Strata Impervia, although the stone is incredibly tough and will quickly wear out tools.
