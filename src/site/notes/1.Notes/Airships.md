#vehicle

Following a set of general agreements between nations and sky-going communities, large Air-vessels are required to have a radio (with a set aside emergency frequency) and signalling capabilities (flags and flares). Smaller vessels are only required to have signals. Personal sized vessels are exempt from these requirements, but most will carry emergency signals and standard flag.

# Lift methods
#### [[1.Notes/Items/Levitation Engine\|Levitation Engine]]
- Pros:
	- Can provide directional movement.
	- Requires less crew to control flight.
- Cons: 
	- Large magical energy requirement.
	- Device/Engine is difficult to produce.
	- Requires trained arcane user to pilot.
- Amount of lift depends on the number of control devices/engines and the quality of their [[1.Notes/Air Crystal\|Air Crystal]]s etc.
- Normally use additional engines for speed/additional lift.

#### [[1.Notes/Liftwood\|Liftwood]] construction/hull
- Pros: 
	- Light, as in not massive.
	- Fast on average.
	- Manoeuvrable on average.
	- Effective as small or large vessels.
	- Does not require pure/channelled magic.
- Cons: 
	- Low armour/durability due to wooden construction. (additional armour will add weight)
	- Expensive liftwood resource can be difficult to source.
	- Flammable.
- Normally lift strength is increased/supplemented with a coating of [[Luftpitch\|Luftpitch]].
- Normally use sails to take advantage of the wind.
- Generally appear similar to regular boats, normally can be set down in water.
- Can be built with a mix of liftwood and normal timber.

#### [[1.Notes/Levistone\|Levistone]] construction or ballast
- Pros: 
	- Heavy, as in massive.
	- Naturally armoured in the case of an airship carved from levistone.
	- Does not require pure/channelled magic.
- Cons: 
	- Poor manoeuvring capabilities by comparison to other types.
	- Production is slow and requires skilled workers.
	- Requires big engines to move.
	- Have to be large to super-large to be effective. 
	- Materials are slow to mine.
- Carved out of slabs of [[1.Notes/Levistone\|Levistone]], magically binded together using [[1.Notes/Earth Crystal\|Earth Crystal]] dust.
- Usually slow moving heavy goods transport/high volume transport.
- Ideal for heavy battleships.
- As Levistone is naturally neutrally buoyant, lifting capabilities and strength comes by way of its use in large quantities to provide enough of a weight buffer, and engines to then control its altitude.

#### [[Lifting gas\|Lifting gas]] filled envelope
- Pros:
	- Fast on average.
	- Completely mechanical.
	- Good load capacity for its size.
- Cons:
	- Poor manoeuvrability.
	- Lifting gas is usually highly flammable.
	- The technology to produce/maintain the mechanic type may not be available. 
	- Owing to the flammable nature, requires armoured envelopes for combat. 
	- Requires a source for lifting gas.
- [[1.Notes/Luftgas\|Luftgas]] production plants by some means produce the buoyant gas (usually Hydrogen) - Electrolysis, Alchemy, Decomposition.
- Helium may be available in some regions due to pockets underground on floating continents.

#### Other methods
- Levitation spell/caster.
- Friendly [[Sky Whale\|Sky Whale]]. 
- Coating of [[Sky Whale\|Sky Whale]] blubber. (acts similar to but more potently than [[Luftpitch\|Luftpitch]])


# Manoeuvring  and Propulsion
- Engines and Propellors.
- Thrusters/Reaction Engines.
	- [[1.Notes/Fire Crystal\|Fire Crystal]] dust.
	- Alchemical Engine.
- [[1.Notes/Items/Levitation Engine\|Levitation Engine]].
- Sails and [[1.Notes/Air Crystal\|Air Crystal]] gems to manipulate the wind. Use of[[1.Notes/Items/Amplifier Staff\|Amplifier Staff]]s.
- Rudders to steer.

# Types of Common Airships
- [[1.Notes/Draking\|Draking]] Ship
	- Fast enough to run down [[Dragon\|Dragon]]s similar to whaling. 
	- Strong enough grapple and tow/carry its prey.
	- Armed with harpoon/ballista sometimes
- Transport Ship
	- Enough lift and room to carry cargo.
	- Fast enough to make for efficient trade routes.
