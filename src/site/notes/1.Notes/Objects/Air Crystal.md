#material #magic #crystal #flight #e-air 
**Type** Ore/Mineral
**Colour** Yellow
**Common State**  Ore, Crystal, Gem

A type of major [[1.Notes/Concepts/Magical Crystal\|Magical Crystal]].

Connected with flight. Crystal and gem forms can be used in [[1.Notes/Objects/Levitation Engine\|Levitation Engine]]s. Active crystals and gems can be used to influence small winds, usually incorporated into [[1.Notes/Objects/Amplifier Staff\|Amplifier Staff]]s called [[1.Notes/Objects/Sky Oar\|Sky Oar]]s to cast gusts of wind to propel sail ships. 

The processed ore dust can be made into a paint/paste that will add aerial buoyancy - this effect is not permanent and the coating needs to be upkept. Air crystals and gems are normally found in Levistone outcrops floating high up. The reliance of air travel makes air crystals quite valuable.

## Properties

### Material Characteristics
A yellow crystal or gem found with a glow.

### Physical & Chemical Properties
A empowered crystal when moved, can cause a breeze.  If thrown, a handful of air crystal dust will cause a small gust of wind in the direction it is thrown. Air crystal dust can be made into a paint that will add a level of aerial buoyancy to whatever it coats

### Geology & Geography
Air crystals are usually found within [[1.Notes/Concepts/Levistone\|Levistone]] outcrops at a high altitude.
