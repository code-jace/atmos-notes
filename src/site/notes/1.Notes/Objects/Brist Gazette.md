A newspaper published in [[1.Notes/Locations/Kronerfort\|Kronerfort]] and distributed throughout [[1.Notes/Locations/Brist\|Brist]].
Publishes more regularly than the [[1.Notes/Objects/Kronerfort Illustrated\|Kronerfort Illustrated]], and provides a more general rule. A bit more populist, than the Kronerfort Illustrated it tends to run sensationalist articles. 
I also runs the upcoming week's weather in the weekend edition.
Publishes daily (only circulated in Kronerfort)
