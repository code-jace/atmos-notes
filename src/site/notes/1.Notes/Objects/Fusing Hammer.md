A fusing hammer is a hammer used by masons to fuse slabs of stone together by way of [[1.Notes/Objects/Earth Crystal\|Earth Crystal]] dust. 
A layer of dust is coated between the surfaces of the 2 slabs to be fused, and then a slab struck with the fusing hammer. The Fusing Hammer has an [[1.Notes/Objects/Energy Crystal\|Energy Crystal]], the power of which is channelled into the dust by the design of the hammer, causing the dust to magically fuse the stones together.
