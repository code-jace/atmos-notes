A Sky Oar is a specialised type of [[1.Notes/Objects/Amplifier Staff\|Amplifier Staff]] that uses [[1.Notes/Objects/Air Crystal\|Air Crystal]] to allow the user to manipulate small gusts of wind, or influence the local air currents. It is used to "row" small lighter-than-air craft around in the sky, much like a regular oar for a boat on water.
