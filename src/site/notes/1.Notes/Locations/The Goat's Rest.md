The Goat's Rest Inn is a Way-house Inn in [[1.Notes/Locations/Brist\|Brist]], run by [[1.Notes/Characters/Tove Grubb\|Tove Grubb]] and [[1.Notes/Characters/Wendel Grubb\|Wendel Grubb]], located on the main road, halfway between the towns of [[1.Notes/Locations/Hamel\|Hamel]] and [[1.Notes/Locations/Mirn\|Mirn]].
It serves as a local pub to the surrounding farms and folk, and also caters to people travelling on the main road.

The Goat's Rest inn is an old farm that has been added to, to build dedicated hostel-style lodging rooms for travelers, after years of putting folk up in the barn, with a friendly-but-temperamental goat (hence the name). It is still a working farm, although that is now second to operating as an inn.
It acts as a meeting place for the local farmers and laborers.

Originally just a farmhouse and barn the house was altered to have the downstairs be a pub after years of the front room having been treated as such. A second co-joining building was added alongside with bedrooms after another year of putting pub-goers and travellers up in the barn. At times of no-vacancy, travellers are still put up in the barn in the empty loft above the animals. They are normally not expected to pay a full nights lodging as there is animal noise and only some straw for comfort.
The barn has space for travellers horses.

## Layout
The farmhouse has the Pub and Kitchen downstairs, and Tove and Wendel's living quarters upstairs, in the converted attic space. The whole building is very home-ly, as a patron of the pub, you are essentially welcomed into Tove and Wendel's home. 

### Pub
in the pub there is.
* a couple of long tables with benches that are communally used (can fit roughly 8 bums comfortably).
* a couple of round tables with 4 or 5 seats
* several small tables with 1 or 2 seats. 

The light is low and the fire is lit each evening. At busy times of the year, a large cauldron of stew will be cooking all day on the flame, filling the pub with delicious smells. At other times, Wendel keeps the cooking in the kitchen, which is behind the bar. 
This is accessed from behind the bar or in a private backroom which has a back door, and a stairs to the 2nd floor.
The lodging house is accessed via a door in front of the bar.
