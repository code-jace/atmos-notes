#location #settlement #town 

Gladeway is a town in the forest located in the North of [[1.Notes/Locations/Brist\|Brist]].
The forest is dense and mostly wilderness. The trees and plants here are numerous and often giant, as a result of the very rich [[1.Notes/Objects/Earth Crystal\|Earth Crystal]] ore content in the soil.
