#location #lake #mountain #e-water 
Lake Vann is a mountain lake towards the summit of [[1.Notes/Locations/Mirn Hill\|Mirn Hill]].
It is surrounded to the north and east sides by the peak of the mountain. The rock making up the peak of the mountain has pockets of high concentration of [[1.Notes/Water Crystal\|Water Crystal]] ore, that cause hundreds of streams to trickle and feed the lake. Rainclouds caught in the shape of the summit are forced to rain, pouring into the basin.
Lake Vann streams down Mirn Hill taking several paths, some gentle, some fast, some subterranean, but all joining up and forming the [[1.Notes/Locations/River Vaan\|River Vaan]] near [[1.Notes/Locations/Mirn\|Mirn]].
