Skywhales are gargantuan, semi-magical mammal beasts, which inhabit the skies.
They naturally fly due to their magical properties.
They travel between very high altitude where they feed on [[1.Notes/Concepts/Star Krill\|Star Krill]] and lower skies, to breath the richer Oxygen content.

Very similar in size and appearance to Blue Whales.
- Size: 
- Tendrils/Barbels/Whiskers

- Sky Whales have no predators, and are mostly peaceful.
- They are attracted to the light of dense Star Krill pockets for feeding.
- The blubber layer of a Sky Whale can be rendered into a paste/oil and spread on objects. This naturally magically acts like a more potent [[Luftpitch\|Luftpitch]], aiding the buoyancy/levitation of the coated object. 
- They can be harvested for valuable materials and resources, this has lead to [[Sky Whaling\|Sky Whaling]], which in turn has lead to a decline in Sky Whale populations.
