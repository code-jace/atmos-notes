#crystal #phenomenon #healing #e-water 
A lake or pond of water which has healing properties.
They are formed when water formed from a [[1.Notes/Objects/Water Crystal\|Water Crystal]] ore layer pools in close proximity to [[1.Notes/Objects/Water Crystal\|Water Crystal]] in their gem or outcrop form this imbues the water with healing powers. [[1.Notes/Objects/Energy Crystal\|Energy Crystal]]s may also need to be present and can boost the powers.

The healing power of this water does not last for long if it is taken from the spring or pool, and for maximum effect should be consumed or bathed in at the site.

A Healing Spring can be naturally magically heated if there is [[1.Notes/Objects/Fire Crystal\|Fire Crystal]] gems or outcrops in close proximity to the water feed stream or pool.
