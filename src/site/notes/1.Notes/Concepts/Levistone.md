**Type** Stone
**Color** Light grey and creams

The foundation of most skylands and floating continents, Levistone is a naturally occurring magically aero buoyant stone. It is light in colour. In large quantities it can support more than its own weight, levitating in the air.

Dwarven airships are carved out of Levistone, using large steam powered propellers to maneuverer.

## Properties

Neutrally aero-buoyant. A fist sized chunk will hang in the air if it dropped.

### Geology & Geography

Levistone makes up the core and foundation of most floating islands.
