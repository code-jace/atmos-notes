#material #magic 
_Crystal is used here sometimes as a general term to refer to the magical material that occurs in many forms (Ore, Crystal, Gem, Dust)._
**Type**: Ore/Mineral
**Colour**: Depends on the type of crystal. Usually found as Green, Yellow, Red, Blue, White/Electric Blue.

Crystals that are naturally rich in magical energy can be found throughout the world. Levistone outcrops are mined for crystal ore veins. Mountains are deep tunnelled. As they occur, crystals can range from activity from stable to highly volatile. The act of mining crystals and crystal ore can destabilise some types. There is a wide range of crystals of various colours and hues. These occur in different setting s and have different effects and hence different (industrial) uses. Crystals and their ores have a glow that fades as their power is used up.

Crystals occur underground and in rocks as Ore, in a similar manner to metals. An outcrop of crystal structures can also occur. On rare occasion, raw gems can be found. The mining of ore is relatively safe, as the small pieces in the rock are less volatile. More care has to be taken when uncovering gems as if they are struck or cracked they can become unstable and surge energy or explode. Crystals are the same, and caution has to e taken to make clean breaks when harvesting them. Specialist tools are used. Ore can be processed into Dust, which is used mostly as a fuel or alchemical reagent. Sometimes large ore chunks can be processed into cut gems and the pieces of ore are sorted during processing for this reason. A fine cut on a gem stabilises its magic and makes it more regular to wield.

There is 4 major Elemental types of crystal, with different properties and therefore uses.
- [[1.Notes/Objects/Earth Crystal\|Earth Crystal]]
- [[1.Notes/Objects/Air Crystal\|Air Crystal]]
- [[1.Notes/Objects/Fire Crystal\|Fire Crystal]]
- [[1.Notes/Objects/Water Crystal\|Water Crystal]]
The other major type of crystal, is the [[1.Notes/Objects/Energy Crystal\|Energy Crystal]], which is normally used as a power source in conjunction with other crystal types or magical devices.

A crystal may have a more inert or non-active state. Agitating the crystal, or bringing it into contact with an Energy Crystal will release it's energy and effect.

## Properties

### Material Characteristics
Crystals of various colours which have a slight glow if they contain magical energy. This glow intensifies if the energy is being used. They grow dull when the energy is used up.

### Physical & Chemical Properties
The properties of a Magical Crystal depends on the type of crystal.  The state of a Magical Crystal affects how it is used.

-   Ore is usually a stable occurrence of the crystal that needs to be processed.
-   Crystal and Crystal Outcrops have energy that can be unleashed or channelled directly.
-   A Rough Gem is similar to Crystals, but with more condensed power - they have more power density, but are naturally more unstable. A Rough Gem can be be "Cut" and shaped to increase their stability.
-   Dust is processed from Ore, to increase its purity, and so increase its magical charge. It can be used in measured amounts. It is more volatile.

### Origin & Source
Crystals occur underground and in rocks as Ore. Buried, or in caves as Crystals and Crystal Outcrops. Rarely found as raw gems in rocks like geodes, or buried. Large ore pieces can be processed into gems, while smaller ore pieces are processed into Dust. In terms of natural occurrence, Magical Crystals are most commonly found in Ore form, then Crystal Form, and most rarely in rough Gem Form.
