- Lives in the high skies. 
- Consumes light and airborne compounds.
- Main food source of [[1.Notes/Concepts/Sky Whale\|Sky Whale]]s.
- Bio-luminescent, this is visible when dense groups of Star Krill gather in large pockets (this attracts Sky Whales to feed). This is where they get their name from.
