#material #flight 
A term used to refer to the wood from any species of tree that has a magical aerial buoyancy.

During the upheaval many forest lands were transformed by the magical energies. This effected many trees into mutating into a Liftwood species - that is, a tree who's wood floats in air. The seeds from these trees then spread in the winds, so that Liftwoods are not too rare.

Some skylands are held together by the roots of a giant Liftwood or Liftwood forest, and held aloft by the woods. These are quite rare and home to druidic settlers. Here they use the leaves for a festival in autumn, where wishes are written on the leaves. As they dry and "fall" they float carrying the wishes into the sky. 

Liftwood is normally sustainably farmed by the countries, as it is used in making airships. Many of the first airships were small liftwood sailboats that would ride the air currents between nearby skylands.  These were fitted with engines as technology advanced, increasing their range.

## Properties

### Physical & Chemical Properties
The wood has lighter than air properties, and can support additional weight. This can be boosted with [[1.Notes/Objects/Energy Crystal\|Energy Crystal]]s and energy crystal dust.
