**Alternative Name(s)**
The Barrier Sea, The Storm Sea, Strata Impervia

Cutting the skies off from the skies is a layer of magical cloud. An unsurvivable layer that appears as a floor to the world of the skies. It is made of cloud and acts as a sea, although there is few crafts that would sail it. This is because, while an object or creature would float in the barrier cloud at first, over a short period of time, that body will lose its buoyancy and sink, falling below its surface and most likely drowning. 

No one has ever returned once they have equalised with the barrier sea and sunk below its surface. 

Magical storms occur throughout it, with lightning lighting up sections in rumbles, and arcane whines being carried along by unknown currents. The layer is not limited to the clouds however, and is more accurately an altitude. Even the Mountaintops which pass through this layer have a magically unpassable layer of magical bedrock where the intersection occurs. This is known as the [[1.Notes/Strata Impervia\|Strata Impervia]]. 

The sea is rumored to be inhabited by crystal beasts.
