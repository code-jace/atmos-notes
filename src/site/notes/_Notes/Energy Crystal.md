**Type** Crystal/Mineral
**Color** White, Electric Blue
**Common State** Ore, Crystal, Gem

A major type ofÂ [[_Notes/Magical Crystal\|Magical Crystal]]. While not containing an energy of a particular elemental magic type, energy crystals contain an amount of raw arcane energy. Energy crystals can be used to increase the magical power, efficiency,  or output of other crystals. They are regularly used to power some magical devices, especially those which rely on the reaction of crystals. 
An example of their use might be in a gem-lifted type flying craft. The craft might be lifted and made buoyant by a large [[_Notes/Air Crystal\|Air Crystal]] Gem in its [[_Notes/Items/Levitation Engine\|Levitation Engine]], but to magically move the craft and gain lift, the Air Gem must be fuelled energy from Energy Crystals.


## Properties

### Material Characteristics
Normally appearing in crystal form, as an outcrop or geode vein in rock. 

### Physical & Chemical Properties
Can increase or boost the output of other crystal types. Can be used in the construction and to power some magical devices.

### Geology & Geography
Energy Crystals are normally found as crystal outcrops in caverns, or as geode veins. While deposits of Energy Crystals can be found in rock or the ground in most landmasses, Energy Crystals of a higher energy content are more commonly found close to the [[_Notes/Strata Impervia\|Strata Impervia]] or in small floating landmasses close to the [[_Notes/Barrier Cloud\|Barrier Cloud]].
Care must be taken in cases where Energy Crystals occur nearby other more volatile crystals as they can boost the volatility and power of those crystals.
