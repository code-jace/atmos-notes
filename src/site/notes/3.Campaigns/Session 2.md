# Notes

- From last time: After breakfast in [[1.Notes/Locations/The Goat's Rest\|The Goat's Rest]] Inn, [[1.Notes/Characters/Tove Grubb\|Tove Grubb]] asked the party if they had seen a girl the night before. They had not. Local Farmer-Blacksmith [[1.Notes/Characters/Jerd Halstor\|Jerd Halstor]] is worried about his daughter not coming home.
- [[Onyx Terra\|Onyx Terra]] Digs a hole outside the inn with his shovel and finds nothing. He covers over the hole.
- The party go down the road to check in on Jerd. He lets them know that his daughter, [[1.Notes/Characters/Alica Halstor\|Alica Halstor]] did not return last night from visiting [[Esra Hetham\|Esra Hetham]] in [[1.Notes/Locations/Homel\|Homel]]. Jerd is very worried and sad, and it comes across that he is a widower. He lets his dog [[Win\|Win]] go with the party to help with following Alica's tracks. They upset the man, cruelly. Echo tells him that he is only doing it to make his daughters return all the sweeter. This might be lost on the man's grief.
- The party follow the road back past the inn and towards Homel.
- Not too far from the inn, at a section of the road where it meets the [[TODO Goats rest Forest\|TODO Goats rest Forest]], win starts sniffing at the edge of the road. 
- [[Artemis\|Artemis]] notices that a section of the undergrowth has been rearranged to hide some tracks, off into the forest to the North.
- The party investigate the tracks with [[Atticus Wrookery\|Atticus Wrookery]] taking point and [[Onyx Terra\|Onyx Terra]] trying to track parallel to the rest of the party in the deeper undergrowth.
- [[Atticus Wrookery\|Atticus Wrookery]] spots a snare trap, which the party avoids, and a little while later along the path, a pit trap, which the whole party succeeds in getting around. 
- Onyx looses sight of the party and gets lost. He digs a hole with his shovel. They party find him with the noise.
- The party comes to a clearing with some tents in it. They are being stealthy and not seen.
- At first they see some sentries in the trees, but after further reconnaissance via Atticus' Hawk [[Aaerow\|Aaerow]] they figure that they are outnumbered in a fight. The hawk reported 12 people. They want to search the camp for Alica, as they suspect (and are following her scent) that she has been captured.
- They decide to split up. [[Onyx Terra\|Onyx Terra]] walks straight in. [[Artemis\|Artemis]] stealthily goes around the edge of the camp, behind some tents.  [[Atticus Wrookery\|Atticus Wrookery]] follows her. [[Dar-el\|Dar-el]] waits outside the camp, ready to turn into a bear and attack. [[Echo\|Echo]] flys around through the trees stealthily.
- As soon as he is seen, Onyx is met with initial hostility. The leader of the "Bandits" [[1.Notes/Characters/Dorn Modak\|Dorn Modak]] starts to question him, and recognises him from his time in [[1.Notes/Locations/Mirn\|Mirn]] - they used to share a mining shift at the mines.
- Atticus and Artemis get found behind some tents and are brought into the camp at crossbow point, they, and Onyx, successfully lie about not knowing each other. Atticus says that they are looking for a girl and wonder if she is here. Onyx says he is lost in the forest. 
- Dorn tells them that he doesnt want to hurt anyone, or lose any men, but that no-one can leave for the next 3 days.
- Dorn sounds out Onyx, bringing him to his tent. He tells Onyx about how he and the other "Bandits" were all fired from the Mines in [[1.Notes/Locations/Mirn\|Mirn]], made redundant by the purchase of a new drilling machine. He shows him plans for a heist on a armoured wagon of metals and ore coming from that will be passing through the forest. Onyx is willing to team up with them. He won Dorn's trust.
- They return to the party. 
- Dar-el comes into camp and is met with aimed crossbows.
- Dorn lets it slip that they do have [[1.Notes/Characters/Alica Halstor\|Alica Halstor]] captured but insists that they are treating her well, and that she will be allowed to go home after 3 days. He does not want any word spreading that they are hiding out in the forest for the next 3 days.
- [[Echo\|Echo]] is stealthily checking the tents. He finds Alica and cuts the rope that she is tied with.
- Dorn explains that [[Glin\|Glin]], one of his men captured Alica and her horse as she was riding to [[1.Notes/Locations/Homel\|Homel]] with the hope that she could be ransomed. He is annoyed with Glin.
- Echo is making a good escape with Alica, but Alica hides poorly and is spotted. 
- After a tense standoff things deescalate. 
- The party agree to remain for the 3 days, but want to send word to [[1.Notes/Characters/Jerd Halstor\|Jerd Halstor]].
- Dorn allows Onyx to travel with the news that she is staying in Homel with [[Esra Hetham\|Esra Hetham]], but he must return that day.
