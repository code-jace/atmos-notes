# Notes

- The Characters all, for one reason or another found themselves in [[1.Notes/Locations/The Goat's Rest\|The Goat's Rest]] inn. It was just starting to get dark. It is the end of autumn.
- [[1.Notes/Characters/Player Characters/Atticus Wrookery\|Atticus Wrookery]], was swindling the locals out of their copper pieces at cards. His aunt figure [[Artemis\|Artemis]] was keeping an eye and scoping out the patronage. They had travelled from her workshop on the outskirts of [[1.Notes/Locations/Kronerfort\|Kronerfort]], and were headed for [[1.Notes/Locations/Mirn\|Mirn]], looking to trade in metals.
- A halfling [[Onyx Terra\|Onyx Terra]], was scoping out the tavern.
- [[Dar-el\|Dar-el]] was in a corner keeping to himself and keeping an eye out.
- [[Echo\|Echo]] was in the inn to sell some bottles of light, they think. (they had memory loss, and a sore horse-shoe shaped mark on their head).
- [[Gimli\|Gimli]], a blue dragonborn was brooding to himself.
- [[1.Notes/Characters/Player Characters/Atticus Wrookery\|Atticus Wrookery]] won a bottle of light from [[Echo\|Echo]], this may or may not be done with trickery.
- When [[Onyx Terra\|Onyx Terra]] loses cards to [[1.Notes/Characters/Player Characters/Atticus Wrookery\|Atticus Wrookery]], he notices that there is something not right with them. However, when he inspects them, they are plain cards (Atticus had managed to switch them out). In anger, Onyx throws his mug of ale, which narrowly misses [[Dar-el\|Dar-el]].
- [[Dar-el\|Dar-el]] goes to start a fight with [[Onyx Terra\|Onyx Terra]]. He does not manage a grab, but Onyx manages to climb him. [[1.Notes/Characters/Player Characters/Atticus Wrookery\|Atticus Wrookery]] tries to calm the situation down, as does [[Artemis\|Artemis]]. Onyx tries to choke Dar-el out, but is thrown off. 
- [[Echo\|Echo]] notices [[Sheep Farmer\|Sheep Farmer]] covered in blood running to the inn.
- [[Sheep Farmer\|Sheep Farmer]] bursts in and asks for help. He is very upset. His sheep are being attacked by wolves.
- The group go down the road to help out. [[Dar-el\|Dar-el]] insists that they should not kill the wolves. 
- When they get to the field, there is a carnage of wool. Some white, some red...
- [[Artemis\|Artemis]], [[1.Notes/Characters/Player Characters/Atticus Wrookery\|Atticus Wrookery]], and [[Dar-el\|Dar-el]] spy 2 Gnolls, at the far end of the field.
- The party, except for [[Dar-el\|Dar-el]] try to kill the wolves. However, the Gnolls also start shooting at them with their longbows.
- The sheep try to escape to the farmers house. One more sheep is run down by a couple of wolves and is killed. 2 more wolves flank around the party, but are handled by [[Dar-el\|Dar-el]] who calms them for the time being. He hears the Gnoll's whistling to try control the wolves.
- [[1.Notes/Characters/Player Characters/Atticus Wrookery\|Atticus Wrookery]] is attacked by wolves and arrows and goes unconscious. He is healed by [[Echo\|Echo]]. 
- [[Onyx Terra\|Onyx Terra]] heals himself.
- One Gnoll is killed by [[Gimli\|Gimli]]'s firebolt. The other Gnoll runs off.
- The two wolves that were attacking the sheep are picked off. 
- One of the flanking wolves is killed by [[Onyx Terra\|Onyx Terra]], the last wolf, after being injured, escapes to lick its wounds.
- The party go back to the inn. Drinks are on [[Sheep Farmer\|Sheep Farmer]]. 
- [[1.Notes/Characters/Stunner\|Stunner]] is at the bar.?
- The party sleep for the night. 
- At breakfast, the next morning, [[1.Notes/Characters/Tove Grubb\|Tove Grubb]] asks if they saw the blacksmith's daughter last night. She was supposed to make it home from [[1.Notes/Locations/Homel\|Homel]]. [[1.Notes/Characters/Jerd Halstor\|Jerd Halstor]] is worried about his daughter....
