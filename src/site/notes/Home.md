# The World of Terra Atmos
The Skies, the untamed slipstreams, the circling up-drafts, the quiet doldrums. Breaking the clouds are archipelagos of mountaintop lands, skylands and floating plateaus. The surface has become uninhabitable wastes driving Nations, Kingdoms, Settlements and Civilisations to take to the higher land. The skies have been a home for generations.

Islands with foundations of Levistone, a mineral with the power to repel gravity, dot the skies. Raw energy can be found in crystal outcrops and veins underground. New discoveries in naturalism and the sciences have given rise to an age of science that complements and in many ways replaces magic. Throughout the lands inventors work, creating machines and technologies. One such discovery was that of mechanical flight. No longer a thing of pure magic, and now made accessible. It is the age of Flight, and the skies are no longer the limits.

The rise of these technologies has also changed the way civilisation acts, new political structures rise and fall. In places towns have banded together, forming new republics. In others, great and mighty leaders found empires. 

It is an interesting and eventful time to be alive.
